# Halite Starter Kits

These starter kits are meant to be used with https://halite-tournament.fly.dev/.

Feel free to check out some of the [original starter kits](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite/tree/master/airesources) for languages
we don't have yet.

## How to use this?

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/nmalaguti/halite-starter/releases) and download the zip file for the language of your choice.
Extract it into a new directory and make a [new repository on Github](https://github.com/new). Follow the instructions to initialize a
new repo and push the files to Github.

This will create a Github Action to package your bot into a docker image and publish it to the github container registry! You'll be
able to use these docker images to register your bot.
